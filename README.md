# Prisma Singleton Pattern for Node.js Applications

This repository (or code snippet) demonstrates a robust pattern for managing a single instance of `PrismaClient` in a Node.js application. This approach is crucial for preventing common issues like excessive database connections, especially during development with features like hot-reloading.

## The Problem: Multiple PrismaClient Instances

Without careful management, your Node.js application, particularly in a development environment that might use hot-reloading or re-evaluate modules multiple times, can inadvertently create numerous `PrismaClient` instances. Each `PrismaClient` instance maintains its own connection pool to your database. Creating too many can lead to:

- **Resource Exhaustion:** Quickly hitting your database's connection limits.
- **Performance Degradation:** Overheads from establishing and managing many connections.
- **Unexpected Behavior:** Inconsistent state or errors due to multiple clients interacting with the database.

## The Solution: Global Singleton Pattern

The provided code implements a singleton pattern using the Node.js global object (`globalThis`) to ensure that only a single `PrismaClient` instance is created and reused throughout the application's lifecycle.

## The Code Explained

Let's break down the code snippet:

```javascript
import { PrismaClient } from "../generated/prisma/index.js";

const globalForPrisma = globalThis;

export const db = globalForPrisma.prisma || new PrismaClient();

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  globalForPrisma.prisma = db;
}
```
